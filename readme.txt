Power up your WordPress site with Laboratory, an all-in-one solution for easier content management, site customization and social network integration.

== Description ==

Laboratory is a set of modular WordPress extensions packed into one bundle. In this initial release, Laboratory comes with several modules such as a custom CSS/HTML editor, a shortlink generator, a custom login page editor, a dynamic menu generator, a responsive slideshow generator, a tabs widget, and the Socialcast that integrates your site with social networks.

All modules work independently so you can activate the ones you want to use and leave the others off.

Laboratory works with all themes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Laboratory will, in theory, work with any theme. Certain parts may need to be styled using CSS in order to match the theme's look. We've added a default styling for Twenty Ten (the WordPress default theme).
